 * \brief Functions to compute the optimal cosine parameters
 *
 * This declares the prototypes for functions to compute the optimal cosines
 * {\f$ a_j \f$, j=1,...,2p} which minimize the maximum norm on 0 < x < 1 of:
 *
 *  \f$ e(x) = \exp(-\eta/x)*((1-x)/(1+x))*\prod_{j=1}^{2p} (a_j-x)/(a_j+x) \f$
 *
 * There are two options available. The first is to directly computed the optimal
 * cosines for a set of given parameters. The second is to try to compute a set
 * of of optimal cosines using the fewest terms necessary to meet a given error
 * tolerance.
 *  
 * These are parameters used to contruct optimal local radiation boundary
 * conditions for the wave equation and related systems. Details can be 
 * found in [1]. 
 *
 * As suggested in [1], we will use the Remez algorithm to approximate the
 * solution to the minimax problem. The implementation here is based upon the 
 * second presentation of the Remez algorithm in [2]. A more procedural and 
 * example based description of the algorithm is available at [3].
 *
 * The remez algorithm requires a root finding algorithm. For this, we use
 * Brent's Method (see, e.g., [4,5]).
