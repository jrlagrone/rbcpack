abstract = "A new technique of free-space simulation has been developed for solving unbounded electromagnetic problems with the finite-difference time-domain method. Referred to as PML, the new technique is based on the use of an absorbing layer especially designed to absorb without reflection the electromagnetic waves. The first part of the paper presents the theory of the \{PML\} technique. The second part is devoted to numerical experiments and to numerical comparisons with the previously used techniques of free-space simulation. These comparisons show that the \{PML\} technique works better than the others in all cases; using it allows us to obtain a higher accuracy in some problems and a release of computational requirements in some others.
