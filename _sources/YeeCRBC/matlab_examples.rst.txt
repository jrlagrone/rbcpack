Implementation Examples in Matlab 
=================================

The following examples are meant to better illustrate the information given in
the :doc:`theory overview <theory_overview>`.

1D Klein-Gordon
---------------

This is one of the simplest examples that demonstrates the effectiveness of the 
CRBC/DAB type boundary conditions.

2D Wave Equation
----------------

This example shows how the boundary conditions can be implemented in 2D on a 
single boundary face for a scalar wave equation.

2D Klein-Gordon with a Corner
-----------------------------

The example implements a corner where two DAB layers intersect for the 2D 
Klein-Gordon equation.
